    <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">MI clinched the impossible win!</h2>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">In the close combat between MI and KKR hte five times champion managed to pull the match towards them and grabbed it!
    it's probably a habitual stuff from MI as they have done this several times.kkr were looking really strong from the start of the inning,they just needed 31 runs in 31 balls.a run a ball stuff.but MI were positive throughout the innings and that positive intent with special performance grabbed them the first win of the season.</p>

    <p style="font-size:2.4rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Rohit Sharma has been the most successful Captain of ipl for a reason. and he proved it again by cleverly using the bowling and the feild.
    although many catches were dropped and no ball at very crucial stage of the match, but he stood and kept supporting his mates to bring the best out of them.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p style="font-size:2.4rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Another day another sensational knock from SuryaKumar Yadav. he was batting with an ease and smoothly placed the ball to the gaps.he is really doing well
    and improving day by day.there is a master class reflect in his batting.sky scored 56 run off 36 balls including 7 fours and 2 classic sixes.</p>

    <img style="width:100%" src="https://image.crictracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rahul-Chahar.jpg" alt="">
    <p style="font-size:2.4rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Rahul Chahar was excellent with the ball and bowled a one man show spell which rewarded him the man of the match award. when the KKR opener were sttled
    and MI was failing to take a single wicket, chahar came with his magical spell and cleaned the top order single handedly. picked the top 4 wickets of the kkr batting line up and stealed the show.</p>
    <br>

    <img style="width:100%" src="https://cdn.insidesport.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/11200415/EysvrfVU8AUWxVT.jpg" alt="">
    <p style="font-size:2.4rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Nitish Rana started his IPL 2021 really well and continued the form against the MI.he provided a required start to the team and got his back to back 50s.

    <img style="width:100%" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/04/f1bde-16183339549806-800.jpg" alt="">
    <p style="font-size:2.4rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Russel failed to steal the show with the bat, but he did it with the ball. MI is all known for it's ruthless finishing, but the muscle man stop them from doing that.
