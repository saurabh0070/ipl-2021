          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">DC and chase-prefect love story</h2>
          <br>
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">DC has chased down another thriller in chennai where teams were struggling to chase the total.
          DC executed the batting really well and their margin of errors were very few. not repeating the mistake of KKR and SRH delhi pulled down the chase against the opponent like MI.DC has some serious strength this time. they may lift the trophy this season.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Dhawan's best of all time</h2>
          <img style="width:100%"  src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202104/Shikhar_Dhawan_PTI1_1200x768.jpeg?goZpmcLvtwLitcYLK9H9LyPIDYvjOVZP&size=770:433" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Dhawan's this season is really going unbeleivable. he is looking very confident with the bat.
          this type of form will surely help his team to win many matches. batting decently he maked the total easy for team on such dangerous pitch. he also consolidated his position in the orange cap list on the top.</p>

          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Steve Smith was in a good touch last night.he came out to bat after the early wicket of the Pruthvi Shaw,
          and made an important partnership with Dhawan to take the team to the stronger position. although Smith likes to bat at such situations as he has done it many of the times.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Rohit's mis-execution</h2>
          <img style="width:100%"  src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/k26ka86_rohit-sharma-one-hand-six-mumbai-indians-bcciipl_625x300_20_April_21.jpg?q=60" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Rohit Sharma has started the innings really well in almost every matches, but he is continuesly failing to convert
          his starts into the big ones which he does for team india. he is the important batsman for the team. team needs his big scores to win the matches as he is capable of doing big things.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Amit Mishra strikes</h2>
          <img style="width:100%"  src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202104/amitmishradelhi_1200x768.jpeg?jAm_562gJJ5yoXTB1cC0rzK0m.qt40sc&size=770:433" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Amit Mishra excellently performed his job with the ball. his spin resulted a major collapse of the MI batting lineup.
          he picked up 4 crucial wickets including the rohit Sharma's one. he totally changed the game as MI were looking too dangerous from the start of the innings.</p>
