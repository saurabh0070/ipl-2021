  <h2>An edge to edge battle between the gaints:</h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>last night we've witnessed the first match of the ipl 2021 edition. the match was full of excitement and was turning like flipping a coin.
  although it was a last ball thriller.the match witnessed so many stars and performances. lets take a look on some of the key moments of the matches:</p>
  <br>
  <h2>harshal's fifer:</h2>
  <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/9g7umd1o_harshal-patel-bcciipl_625x300_09_April_21.jpg?q=60" alt="">
  <br>
  <p>the man of the match with that magical spell! Harshal patel starred in the rcb's bowling with picking the most important 5 wickets of the mighty mi lineup.
  althouht he was expensive in his very first over,still managed to pick 5 wickets by conceding just 27 runs off 4 overs.his last over of the innings was fabulous,and even the diffrence of the whole match.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>ABD the savior again!!</h2>
  <img style="height:450px; width:500px;" src="https://www.indiafantasy.com/wp-content/uploads/ABD-SIX.jpg" alt="">
  <br>
  <p>even though rcb has started well there innings, but at the crucial stage of the match they lost their most imp wickets.the match was nearly in the hands of the mi.
  but like every time abd the superman proved his worth in the team by hitting 48 0ff just 27 including 2 huge sixes and handed the win to rcb.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>lynnsanity!!!</h2>

  <br>
  <p>we had an hero from the losing side as well.the man came to start the innings along with the captain.but mistakenly he ran-out rohit.
  with such a big mistake he had the job to be done.later then he proved his name by hitting 49 off 35 with 3 gigantic sixes.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>along with all of this we have seen the surya's classy 31, the ishan kishan cameo, maxi the x-factor, and many more.now all eyes on the mumbai indians how they're gonna comeback in upcoming matches.</p>
