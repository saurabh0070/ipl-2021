   <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem;">The most uderrated rivalry of IPL!</h2>
   <p style="font-size:2.4rem;">cricket was at it's best last night.the two teams PB and RR came head to head again and an intense battle was seen again between them.
   absolutely the most uderrated rivalry.since last few matches whenever they're facing each other,the match is going real high voltage.so let's take a look at last night's war:</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem;">MR.Consistent of ipl</h2>
   <img style="width:100%;" src="https://newindialife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IPL-2021-RR-vs-PBKS-Live-Score-Updates-KL-Rahul.jpg" alt="">
   <p style="font-size:2.4rem;">KL Rahul is been in a fabulous form since last three seasons.he is scoring with such an accurate consistency since last three years.same
   what we have seen last night.the Klassy Rahul knock.it was a joy to watch his batting throughout the innings.scoring 91 runs off 50 balls he
 took his team to the competitve score.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem;">The unexpected innings!</h2>
 <img style="width:100%;" src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2021/04/eyymz-bu8aywopl-1618247976.jpg" alt="">
 <p style="font-size:2.4rem;">After the wicket of chris Gayle punjab sent Deepak Hooda to bat.it was little awkward decesion to send him before Nicholas Pooran.
 but as the match goes on, he shocked everyone with his terrifying innings of 64 off just 28 ball hitting 6 huge sixes.a real surprise package for RR.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem;">Captain leaded from front!</h2>
 <img style="width:100%;" src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2020/10/1603691536_sanju-samson.jpg" alt="">
 <p style="font-size:2.4rem;">A pure samson storm was seen on wankhede stadium last naight.a carnival of clean hitting.samson played a one man army role by hitting the very first century of the season.
 the pure talent was reflected throughout the innings. he simply showed what he is capable of doing.it was a much deserving win for samson but unluckily can't connect the last ball well where 5 runs was needed to win the match. </p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem;">others:</h2>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3 style="font-size:2.9rem;">Parag the all-rounder</h3>
 <p style="font-size:2.4rem;">An all-round performance was seen by the young man Riyan Parag.he came to bat at the crucial stage off the match and hitted a blistering knock of 25(11) and took an important wicket of Chris Gayle who was looking very dangorous. the all round performancr of parag is good signs for RR.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3 style="font-size:2.9rem;">In RRvsPB storm young bowlers shined</h3>
 <p style="font-size:2.4rem;">One side the batsmen were playing with the bowlers with an ease, on other hand arshdeep and sakariya were bowling at diffrent pitch.the batsmen find it difficult to hit this two young bowlers.both bowled really well picking 3 wickets each.</p>
