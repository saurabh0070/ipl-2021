    <img style="width:100%" src="https://hindi.cdn.zeenews.com/hindi/sites/default/files/2021/04/11/803803-nitish-rana.jpg" alt="Rana">
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:1.5rem;">Nitish Rana started his ipl 2021 season with an excellent innings against srh.he came out to open the innings and looked good throughout the innings.
    he is enhancing really well at the opening position.in his blistering knock of 80(56) he added 9 fours and 4 sixes.let's see he continues the form throughout the season or not.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Tripathi's 50</h2>
    <img style="width:100%" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/04/3bb2b-16178891847273-800.jpg" alt="rt">
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:1.5rem;">After Gill departed very early captain Morgan sent tripathi at no.3 to show his game.he brilliantly grabbed the opportunity and showed his
    batting skills very well. along with Rana he continuesly accelerated the innings of kkr to make them to the smart total.young man scored 53 off just 28 balls.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Pandey's effort goes in vein</h2>
    <img style="width:100%" src="https://cdn2.tv9hindi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pjimage-2021-04-04T160143.863.jpg" alt="">
    <p style="font-size:1.5rem;">chasing the total of 188 srh lost their 2 wickets at early stage of saha(7) and warner(3).then Manish came out to bat and anchored the innings
    nicely and almost got his team close to the total.but in the final overs kkr bowled in control and pandey failed to win the match for team.scored
  a nice 61(44) hitting 2 fours and 3 sixes.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Others:</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>DK the finisher</h3>
    <p style="font-size:1.5rem;">Dinesh Karthik's major short cameo became the diffrence of the match.after losing important wickets DK came out and added the finishing
    touch to the innings with a beautiful 22 off just 9 balls.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Bairstow's position puzzle</h3>
    <p style="font-size:1.5rem;">SRH fans were expecting Bairstow to open the innings but he came to bat at no.4 position.although he was doing his job quite nicely,but
    opening the innings may has added the diffrence to the match as we all know how dangerous he is as an opener.let's see where the captian will use him for upcomin matches.</p>
