          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">RR's money game worked!</h2>
          <br>
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Another day of ipl 2021 and another low scoring thriller! it was a pure thriller in the last 3 4 overs of the game.27 runs were needed
          in the last two overs, and who finished? "the big money morris"! RR totally dethroned the DC bowling attack in last moment of the match, and won the thriller.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Miller's worth exclusion</h2>
          <img   style="width:100%" src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2021/04/untitled-6-copy-1618508863-1618509546.jpg" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">David Miller who got the chance after stokes injury has palyed a major key role in the RR's win.the top order of RR were collapsed too early
          without much contribution.DC bowlers were almost done their job. but you ain't underestimate the killer miller. he excellently carried the team towards win in the middle overs scoring a knock of 62 runs.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Morris the game changer</h2>
          <img   style="width:100%" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/ec6nde28_ipl-rajasthan-royals-chris-morris_625x300_15_April_21.jpg?q=60" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">After the wicket of Miller almost everyone losed the hope of RR's win as the required rate was on peak. but in the last two overs morris totally changed the game
          brilliantly by hitting 4 huge sixes and won the game for his team.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Unadkat's impactfull comeback</h2>
          <img   style="width:100%" src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202104/jaydevtwiiter_1200x768.jpeg?j7tTGkEUURnPsWn7vlD6xAeA24FhwWV1&size=770:433" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">After not getting a chance in the first game, unadkat grabbed the opportunity against DC by performing really well. he bowled an impactfull spell
          picking 3 wickets conceding only 15 runs. he contributed with the bat as well, hitted a beautiful six which helped in the chase.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Captaincy brings maturity</h2>
          <img  style="width:100%"  src="https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2021/03/30/967039-ezgif.com-gif-maker.jpg" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">DC's start was quite bad as they lost nubers of wickets in the starting overs.then Pant came out to bat and played an important innings for the team.
          his innings was a combination of class and maturity.handled the situation really well by hitting a half century and added some crucial runs.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">DC's lower order contribution</h2>
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">After the collapse of the top order, DC's lower order tooked the challenge and taked their team to the respectful total.the lower order added
          51 runs and taked their team to the fighting total. this shows that DC has got some depth in their batting.</p>
