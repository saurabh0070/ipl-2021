        <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">RCB's top class win</h2>
        <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">RCB's bowling department has done an exceptoinal job to clinch the win which was almost in SRH's hand. RCB is showing the tough
        contendership for the trophy by defeating two of the best teams of ipl.this type of performance can surely help them to win their first title.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Maxi solving the batting "puzzle"</h2>
        <img  style="width:100%" src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202104/srhvrcbglennmaxxwellipl2021_1200x768.jpeg?Fan3fxgdCQuMfp4kb7hwV3QCexzj1Oc1&size=770:433" alt="">
        <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Maxwell has done really well in his first two matches. exactly what the team has wanted from him. his innings put the diffrence in the match.
        he has ended the rcb's middle order struggle, and performing his job really well.he scored his 7th 50 in ipl after a 4 years long wait.rcb fans are the happiest ones with his comeback.all we can hope is maxi keep performing throughout the season.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">RCB's new all-rounder</h2>
        <img style="width:100%"  src="https://www.crictracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shahbaz-Ahmed.jpg" alt="">
        <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">RCB got a new star player on thier side in the form of Shahbaz Ahmed. the youngster performed fabulous.he bowled a game changing over
        by picking 3 wickets in it, and even added some runs with the bat.with such efforts he is surely gonna be the most important player of the team in future.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Warner is back!</h2>
        <img style="width:100%"  src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/2oditjb_david-warner-srh-bcciipl_625x300_15_April_21.jpg?q=60" alt="">
        <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Dawid Warner has now arrived in the ipl 2021 by scoring a blistering knock of 54 runs off 37 balls. he added 7 fours and 1 six in his
        classic innings.however he failed to get the target.he has surely regreted as a cpatain as it was an easy win for them. didn't learned from the KKR's mistake.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">others:</h2>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Effortfull Rashid</h2>
        <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Rashid Khan has gave his best in all department. he did the best what he was capable of.bowled really good overs, picked wickets, taked catches, scored some fast runs as well. the complete man. he bringed the match too close while batting.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Harshal shines again</h2>
        <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Harshal looked good in his second match as well.looks like he is a strong contender for the purple cap this season. Virat is using him really well.lets see how far his consistency takes off.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">Williamson the missing part?</h2>
        <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">SRH has surely missed the Williamson's service last night. kane must have added a diffrence in the match, as he is very effective in such chases. SRH must add him in the upcoming matches to strenghten their batting.</p>
