          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">Maxwell is showing his ability throughout the matches with his desire to watch innings. this time maxwell has arrived with diffrent
          plans and execution. he is playing brilliantly according the requirment of the team. he thrashed the kkr bowlers by hitting 78 runs and totally dominated the innings.</p>

          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">A vintage ABD knock was seen last night which was an absolute delight to watch. it was a breathtaking innings which shocked everyone.
          he played his dangerous 360 game and knocked the ball everyside of the ground.AB scored a furious 76 runs off just 34 balls and taked the team to the huge total.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">KKR's batting collaspe</h2>
          <img style="width:100%"  src="https://en.100mbsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Morgan-KKR-e1603908533572.jpg" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">KKR's batsmen thrown their wickets after getting a good start each. no one managed to convert their start into a big one. a batting collapse
          is a major problem of KKR since last few seasons. although they started the season really well where it was looking like the top order is well prepared this time, but after that they again started to struggle with their batting.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2 style="font-size:2.9rem; color:#d8d8d8;">RCB's bowling department shines</h2>
          <img style="width:100%"  src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202104/jamiesonpti_1200x768.jpeg?9ulnTwSb5GKb4SjcA5NLH6fvFFgBstQm&size=770:433" alt="">
          <p style="font-size:2.4rem;  color:#d8d8d8;">After conceding too many runs RCB bowlers managed to comeback with some game changing spells which pushed the KKR side to the backfoot.
          Harshal again done an excellent job with the ball bu picking 2 wickets with an economical spell. Siraj done absolutely well by conceding only 1 run in the second last over against Russel.</p>
